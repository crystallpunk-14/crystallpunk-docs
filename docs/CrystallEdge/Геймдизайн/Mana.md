# Mana
Mana at its basic functionality is a resource to spend to cast spells and other effects. It is the energy used in place of electricity.

This document will detail how mana will be stored and gained.

_Bolded values are subject to change._

## Storage
Mana is stored in a singular way for now.
In the body of a player they will have an internal storage of mana that they can cast from.
- A players mana capacity is determined by their intelligence stat. At **4** mana capacity per intelligence, Players start with **5** intelligence giving them a starting capacity of **20**.

## Gaining
Mana is gained in a couple of ways much like games such as Terraria, Doom, and Ultrakill this is meant to incentivize aggressive play to regain mana. 
1. Mana will not be naturally regenerated over time as this causes boring gameplay of hiding away for 15 minutes.
2. Mana will be rewarded for aggressive play, to do that objects called mana motes will be dropped by monsters separated into bigger ones for higher tier monsters these are used in hand for mana instantly.
3. These mana motes should not be able to be completely self-sufficient to a magic character so they will still have to worry about utilizing their abilities.
4. Mana motes should not be permanent so they will disappear after **10** minutes this is to not incentivize stacking these to cast a bunch of abilities later.
5. The mana mote sizes are as followed:
- Tiny - rewarded for fodder monsters gives back only **2** mana.
- Small - rewarded for regular monsters gives back only **4** mana.
- Medium - rewarded for slightly tougher monsters gives back only **8** mana.
- Large - rewarded for large monsters gives back only **16** mana.
6. The other item important to keeping your mana up are mana potions. Mana potions are purchased in a safe zone or found in the dungeon. They are a more permanent form of mana motes able to be used whenever restoring a high amount of mana.
